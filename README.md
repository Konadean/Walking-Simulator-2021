Console Based Python Collecting Game

This game was a project I used to learn SQL via the SQlite python library. I used databases to store all the information of the items that you can collect.

To get started playing, pull and simply run the protoypeEngine.py file and the game should start running in your console.

There is no 'end game' simply press space bar and see all the encounters you can get. 

Have fun!
